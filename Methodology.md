# Methodology
Size and noise level of brainbow image data prohibit a voxel level approach since the dataset size is so large and individual analysis of each voxel could lead to misinterpretation due to noise. Therefore the strategy used is "(i) a supervoxelization strategy, (ii) explicitly define graph representations on the set of supervoxels, and (iii) design the edge weights to capture the spatio-color relations"

**Hyperspectral imaging**: This type of imaging uses bands of wavelenghts beyond the visible range to capture even more information about color. An example of a popular hyperspectral imaging method is **Nonnegative Matrix Factorization**.

**NMF or NNMF**: Nonnegative Matrix Factorization
