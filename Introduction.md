# Introduction to the problem

```
"...mapping neuronal structures requires a large field of view, a high resolution, a robust labeling technique, and computational methods to sort the data."
```

The labelling technique talked about in the paper is **Braibow** technique. It was developed by Jean Livet, Jeff Lichtman, and their colleagues at Harvard University in 2007. The basic idea of Brainbow is to color individual neruons with different colors and then trace the connectome. 

**Connectome/connectomics**: Connectome is the map of neuronal connections in the brain and its study is referred to as connectomics. It is necessary for brain and disease research.
